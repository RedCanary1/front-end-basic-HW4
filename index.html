        I'll be honest, I don't know what to write about. So since I'm listening
        to music right now, this is going to be just a random list of artists,
        albums and/or songs that I like to listen to while working or just
        existing.

          Oliver Sykes (Frontman/Lead-vocals) has stated on many occasions that
          the band often draws inspiration from a number of sources including
          video games. Mick Gordon famous for his composing/production of "DooM
          2016" took a part in the production of the album. The song "Ludens"
          was made after playing Hideo Kojima's "Death Stranding" The music
          video also features scenes from the game. "Parasite Eve's" name is a
          nod to a 1998 Square Enix game and has been quoted to be inspired by
          "The Last of Us" and "Resident Evil" franchises. Also one of the lines
          "If the suspense doesn't kill you, Something else will" was originally
          used in the 1996 Resident Evil commercial.
